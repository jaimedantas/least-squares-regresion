# Implementation of the regularized least-squares algorithm in MATLAB
The regularized least-squares algorithm is used for regression for finding the machine learning model. This implementation of the RLM uses a polynomial curve fitting problem to analyze the performance over the ERM.

### Features
- RLM analysis for w = 1,2,...,30 with different regularizers;
- ERM analysis for w = 1,2,...,30;
- k-fold cross validation over ERM;
- Empirical loss comparison;


### Dataset
A dataset with 100 data points is used for training the models.

### Documentation
This implementation is part of these two articles published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jaimedantas).
