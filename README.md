# Implementation of the regularized least-squares algorithm in MATLAB
The regularized least-squares algorithm is used in regression for finding machine learning models. This implementation of the RLM uses a polynomial curve fitting problem to analyze the performance over the ERM.

### Features
- RLM analysis for w = 1, 2,..., 30 with different regularizers;
- ERM analysis for w = 1, 2,..., 30;
- k-fold cross validation over ERM;
- Empirical loss comparison;


### Dataset
An one imput dataset with 100 data points is used for training the models.
